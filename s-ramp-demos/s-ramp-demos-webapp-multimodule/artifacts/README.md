# Multi-Module WebApp Demo - Artifacts

The artifacts project contains common artifacts used by the WebApp web project, as well as potentially clients.  The following artifacts are included:

* orderTypes.xsd : XML schema containing data types
* Domain classes : Java domain objects

Building this project will produce a complete, deployable artifact jar containing all XSDs and Java classes
