Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The S-RAMP application is written in Java. To get started make sure your system has the following:

* Java JDK 1.6 or newer
* Apache Ant 1.7 or newer to use the installer
* Maven 3.0.3 or newer to build and run the examples

Download, Installation and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `s-ramp-<version>.zip` (or tar.gz) archive can be downloaded from the http://www.jboss.org/overlord[http://www.jboss.org/overlord]
website. Grab the latest, extract the archive and run:

....
ant install
....

The installer will ask you to choose a runtime platform.  Currently the following platforms are supported:

* JBoss EAP 6
* JBoss Fuse 6.1
* Tomcat 7
* Jetty 8

Simply follow the installer instructions to install onto the platform of your choice.  We recommend installing
into a clean version of which platform you choose, to minimize the risk of colliding with other projects.

Note that you must have already downloaded and installed the platform on which you wish to run, with the 
exception of Tomcat 7 and Jetty 8 (which the installer will download for you if you choose).

Finally, please make sure the admin password you choose (the installer will prompt you for this) contains
letters, numbers, and punctuation (and is at least 8 characters long).

TIP: Read the installer output carefully - extra instructions are given for certain platforms.

Once S-RAMP is installed on your preferred platform, you should be able to go ahead and start it up.  The
instructions for starting the server depend on the chosen platform:

.Tomcat 7
....
bin/startup.sh
....

.Jetty 8
....
bin/jetty.sh run
....

.JBoss EAP 6 (standalone-full is required)
....
bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
....

.JBoss Fuse 6.1
....
bin/fuse
....

Check your Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make sure your installation works you can fire up the http://localhost:8080/s-ramp-ui[s-ramp-ui]. You
should see the GUI dashboard and be able to navigate to either the Artifacts or Ontologies management pages:

[[figure-gs-screenshot-of-the-s-ramp-ui]]
.Welcome screen of the s-ramp-ui.

You can click on `Artifacts` and see a list of files related to the S-RAMP default workflows.

Alternatively you can fire up the `s-ramp shell` in the `bin` directory of the distribution:
....
./bin/s-ramp.sh

....

To connect the shell to the server type `connect` and hit the tab key. It should auto-complete
to say `s-ramp:connect http://localhost:8080/s-ramp-server` and when hitting the return key
you should be prompted for user credentials.  Use 'admin' and whatever password you entered
during installation.  If this succeeds, the shell cursor/prompt will go from red to green. To 
browse the artifacts in the repository (there will likely not be any) run the following query:

....
s-ramp> s-ramp:query "/s-ramp"
Querying the S-RAMP repository:
	/s-ramp
Atom Feed (0 entries)
  Idx                    Type Name
  ---                    ---- ----
....
In later chapters will go into more detail, but if this all worked you can be sure that your installation is in good working order.
