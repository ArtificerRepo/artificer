S-RAMP Data Models
------------------

The S-RAMP specification defines a number of built-in artifact types, while also allowing
clients to define their own (implicit) types.  This section of the Guide describes these
different models.

An artifact may have document (e.g file) content or it may be a purely logical artifact.
In either case, clients typically add artifacts to the repository directly (e.g. via the
S-RAMP Atom API, described later in this guide).

Additionally, some document style artifact types when added to the repository, will result
in the creation of a set of "derived" artifacts.  For example, if an XSD document is
added to the repository, the server will automatically extract the element declarations
from the content of the file resulting in a set of additional artifacts "related" to the
original.  This will be described in detail further in the XSD Data Model section.


Core Data Model (core)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The S-RAMP core model defines some basic artifact types including Document and XmlDocument.
These basic types allow clients to add simple files to the repository as artifacts.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type   |Parent Type    |Properties
|Document        |               |contentType, contentSize, contentHash
|XmlDocument     |Document       |contentEncoding
|=============================


XML Schema (XSD) Data Model (xsd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The XSD model defines a single document style artifact, XsdDocument, and a number of derived
artifact types.  When an XSD document is added to the repository, the server will additionally
"index" the artifact by automatically creating a number of derived artifacts of the following
types from the XSD content.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type          |Parent Type    |Properties
|XsdDocument            |XmlDocument    |targetNamespace
|AttributeDeclaration   |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|ElementDeclaration     |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|SimpleTypeDeclaration  |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|ComplexTypeDeclaration |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|=============================


WSDL Data Model (wsdl)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WSDL model defines a single document style artifact, WsdlDocument, and a number of derived
artifact types.  Similarly to the XsdDocument type, when a WSDL dcument is added to the
repository, the server will automatically derive additional artifacts (listed below) from the
content of the WSDL file.

For further details about the WSDL Model, please see the S-RAMP specification's foundation 
document, section 2.4.2.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type          |Parent Type    |Properties
|WsdlDocument           |XmlDocument    |targetNamespace, xsdTargetNamespaces
|WsdlService            |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|Port                   |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|WsdlExtension          |<derived>      |ncName, namespace

|BindingOperation       |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|BindingOperationInput  |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|BindingOperationOutput |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|BindingOperationFault  |<derived>      |ncName, namespace
|=============================


Policy Data Model (policy)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This data model is present to represent the primary components of a WS-Policy document.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type          |Parent Type    |Properties
|PolicyDocument         |XmlDocument    |
|PolicyExpression       |<derived>      |
|PolicyAttachment       |<derived>      |
|=============================


SOA Data Model (soa)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SOA model exists to provide a link to the work done by the Open Group SOA Ontology group.
All of the artifacts in this model are non-document artifacts which are directly instantiated
by clients.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================

|=============================


Service Implementation Data Model (serviceImplementation)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Service Implementation model adds SOA service implementation artifact types underneath
the (already mentioned) SOA Data Model.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type          |Parent Type    |Properties
|Organization           |               |end
|ServiceEndpoint        |               |end, url
|ServiceInstance        |               |end, url
|ServiceOperation       |               |end, url
|=============================


Custom/Extension Data Models (ext)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients can define their own (implicit) data models by using the "ext" model space defined
by the S-RAMP specification.  This allows clients to add documents with custom artifact types.
For example, a client can add an artifact to /s-ramp/ext/PdfDocument.  This provides a way
for clients to define their own data models with their own properties and relationships.
Note however that the server will not have a definition of the model - it is up to the client
to properly conform to their own implicit model.  Custom properties and user-defined 
relationships allow clients to richly define their own models.

As an example, a client might define the following Data Model for a J2EE web application
domain:

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type          |Parent Type           |Properties
|WebXmlDocument         |ExtendedDocument      |displayName
|ServletFilter          |ExtendedArtifactType  |displayName, filterClass
|Servlet                |ExtendedArtifactType  |servletClass, loadOnStartup
|=============================


Java Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The S-RAMP server adds a custom (ext) model for dealing with Java artifacts.  The following
table lists the Java artifact types that are supported out of the box.  These artifacts can
either be directly added to the repository or they can be added as part of the expansion
of some other artifact.  A typical example of the latter is how JavaClass artifacts may be
added because they are contained within an archive of some kind.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type             |Parent Type           |File Extension   |Properties
|JavaArchive               |ExtendedDocument      |jar              |
|JavaWebApplication        |ExtendedDocument      |war              |
|JavaEnterpriseApplication |ExtendedDocument      |ear              |
|BeanArchiveDescriptor     |ExtendedDocument      |beans.xml        |
|JavaClass                 |ExtendedDocument      |class            |packageName, className
|JavaInterface             |ExtendedDocument      |class            |packageName, className
|JavaEnum                  |ExtendedDocument      |class            |packageName, className
|=============================


KIE Data Model (Knowledge is Everything)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The S-RAMP server includes basic out of the box support for Drools (KIE) artifact types.
The following table lists the KIE artifact types that are currently supported.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type         |Parent Type           |File Extension   |Properties
|KieJarArchive         |ExtendedDocument      |jar              |

|DroolsDocument        |ExtendedDocument      |drl              |
|=============================


SwitchYard Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The S-RAMP server inclues a custom (ext) data model for SwitchYard artifacts.  The following
table lists the artifact types currently supported.  The non-derived artifacts can be added
directly to the repository or expanded out of some archive type artifact.

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type              |Parent Type                             |Properties
|SwitchYardApplication      |ExtendedDocument                        |
|SwitchYardXmlDocument      |ExtendedDocument                        |targetNamespace
|SwitchYardService          |<derived from SwitchYardXmlDocument>    |
|SwitchYardComponent        |<derived from SwitchYardXmlDocument>    |requires
|SwitchYardComponentService |<derived from SwitchYardXmlDocument>    |
|SwitchYardTransformer      |<derived from SwitchYardXmlDocument>    |transformer-type
|SwitchYardValidator        |<derived from SwitchYardXmlDocument>    |validator-type
|=============================

Additionally, the SwitchYard derived artifacts have various relationships automatically
created between and amongst them (as well as to other derived artifacts such as those
derived from XML Schema artifacts).  The following table outlines all the relationships
currently defined in the SwitchYard Model.

[width="75%",options="header"]

|=============================


Teiid Data Model (Teiid)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Teiid model adds Teiid-related artifact types, derived artifacts, and relationships. There 
are artifact types for the following Teiid resources: VDBs (`*.vdb`), models (`*.xml`), VDB 
manifests (usually named `vdb.xml`), and VDB configuration files (`ConfigurationInfo.def`). Teiid 
resources should be added to the repository using the corresponding artifact types listed in the 
following table:

[width="75%",options="header"]
|=============================
|Artifact Type               |Parent Type                     |Properties
|TeiidVdb                    |                                |
|TeiidModel                  |ExtendedArtifactType            |description, maxSetSize, mmuuid, modelType, nameInSource, primaryMetamodelUri, producerName, producerVersion, visible
|TeiidVdbConfigInfo          |ExtendedArtifactType            |
|TeiidVdbManifest            |ExtendedArtifactType            |description, preview, UseConnectorMetadata, vdbVersion, <custom properties>

|TeiidVdbPermission          |<derived from TeiidVdbManifest> |alterable, condition, creatable, deletable, executable, languagable, mask, readable, updatable
|TeiidVdbSchema              |<derived from TeiidVdbManifest> |builtIn, checksum, description, indexName, metadata, metadataType, modelClass, modelUuid, pathInVdb, schemaType, visible, <custom properties>
|TeiidVdbSource              |<derived from TeiidVdbManifest> |jndiName, translatorName
|TeiidVdbTranslator          |<derived from TeiidVdbManifest> |description, translatorType, <custom properties>
|TeiidVdbValidationError     |<derived from TeiidVdbManifest> |message, severity
|=============================

When a `TeiidVDB` or a `TeiidVdbManifest` artifact type is added to the repository, relationships 
between it and its derived artifacts are created. Note that the `TeiidVdbContains` relationship is 
the inverse of the `expandedFromDocument` relationship. Here is a list of the Teiid relationship types:

[width="75%",options="header"]
