The Artificer Browser (UI)
--------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~
The Artificer project comes with a user interface that allows end users (or
more likely business admins) to browse all of the artifacts in the Artificer repository.
This UI is capable of viewing and manipulating all Artificer artifacts in a very
generic way, supporting all aspects of the S-RAMP specification (properties, 
classifiers, relationships, etc).

The browser is a web based application built using GWT and Errai, and is compatible
with all modern web browsers.  Additionally, it is capable of scaling the interface
down to a size that is useful on a smart phone.
