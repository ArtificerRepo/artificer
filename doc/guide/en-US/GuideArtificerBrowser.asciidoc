The S-RAMP Browser (UI)
-----------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~
The Overlord S-RAMP project comes with a user interface that allows end users (or 
more likely business admins) to browse all of the artifacts in the S-RAMP repository.
This UI is capable of viewing and manipulating all S-RAMP artifacts in a very 
generic way, supporting all aspects of the S-RAMP specification (properties, 
classifiers, relationships, etc).

The browser is a web based application built using GWT and Errai, and is compatible
with all modern web browsers.  Additionally, it is capable of scaling the interface
down to a size that is useful on a smart phone.
