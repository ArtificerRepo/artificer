Artificer Server Configuration
------------------------------

Out-of-the-box, Artificer provides a useful, default server configuration.  However, if you'd like to mold it into an
existing setup, here are a few areas that can be modified.

Datasource
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Artificer uses a simple file-based H2 datasource.  However, any existing datasource can be used.
Swap-out the datasource's JNDI name in the following location:

Standalone modes: JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone*.xml
----
      ...
      <cache-container name="modeshape">
        <local-cache name="artificer">
          <locking isolation="READ_COMMITTED"/>
          <transaction mode="NON_XA" locking="OPTIMISTIC"/>
          <eviction strategy="LRU" max-entries="10000"/>
          <string-keyed-jdbc-store datasource="[DATASOURCE JNDI NAME]" passivation="false" purge="false">
            <string-keyed-table prefix="ispn_bucket">
              <id-column name="id" type="VARCHAR(500)"/>
              <data-column name="datum" type="BLOB"/>
              <timestamp-column name="version" type="BIGINT"/>
            </string-keyed-table>
          </string-keyed-jdbc-store>
        </local-cache>
      </cache-container>
      ...

WARNINGS
~~~~~~~~

* Between runs, the ModeShape repository name cannot be changed.  The name is used on multiple paths used for binary storage, search indexes, etc.  Attempting to do so, without changing all necessary paths, will result in ModeShape failures during startup.
* Similarly, between runs, the Infinispan "local-cache" name (and accompanying "cacheName" in the ModeShape config) cannot be changed.  ModeShape includes a hash of the cache name within its node IDs, so changing the name is guaranteed to break your repository.
